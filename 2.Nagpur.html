       <p>    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players each on a field at the centre
 of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The
 game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of 
the pitch towards the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once they have legally done so six
 times. The batting side has one player at each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch
 from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat. The batting side scores runs either when the ball reaches
 the boundary of the field, or when the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run. The fielding 
side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their
 wicket"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails,
 and by the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball
 before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have been 
dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third 
umpire and match referee in international matches.

Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs and the game
 generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white
 kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear 
protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather 
with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.

Carrom is a tabletop game of South Asian origin. The game is very popular in the Indian subcontinent, and is known
by various names in different languages. In South Asia, many clubs and caf√©s hold regular tournaments. Carrom is
very commonly played by families, including children, and at social functions. Different standards and rules exis
 in different areas. It became very popular in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth during the early 20th century.
              The word carrom simply means any strike and rebound. The game of carrom originated in India.[1] One
 carrom board with its surface made of glass is still available in one of the palaces in Patiala, India.[2] It 
became very popular among the masses after World War I. State-level competitions were being held in the different 
states of India during the early part of the 20th century. Serious carrom tournaments may have begun in Sri Lanka 
in 1935 but by 1958, both India and Sri Lanka had formed official federations of carrom clubs, sponsoring tournaments
 and awarding prizes

Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played 
with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles"
 (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal 
games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and
 landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.

Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has 
struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing 
side.

Chess is a board game for two players.[1] It is played on a square board, made up of 64 smaller squares, with eight
 squares in each row and column. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two 
rooks, one queen and one king.[2] The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the 
opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.[3][4]

During the game, the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One 
player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules
 about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always
 makes the first move.[4] Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament 
games.[5][6]

Chess is popular and is often played in competitions called chess tournaments. It is enjoyed in many countries,
 and is a national hobby in Russia.
