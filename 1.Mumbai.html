cricket, England’s national summer sport, which is now played throughout the world, particularly in Australia,
 India, Pakistan, the West Indies, and the British Isles.

Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The field is oval
 with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres) 
wide. Two sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across the top of
 each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails. The sides take turns at batting and bowling (pitching); each turn 
is called an “innings” (always plural). Sides have one or two innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of
 the match, the object being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to
 break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is
 dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an “over”), then a different 
player from his side bowls six balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket.

Table tennis, also known as ping-pong and whiff-whaff, is a sport in which two or four players hit a lightweight
 ball, also known as the ping-pong ball, back and forth across a table using small solid rackets. The game takes
 place on a hard table divided by a net. Except for the initial serve, the rules are generally as follows: players 
must allow a ball played toward them to bounce once on their side of the table and must return it so that it bounces 
on the opposite side at least once. A point is scored when a player fails to return the ball within the rules. Play 
is fast and demands quick reactions. Spinning the ball alters its trajectory and limits an opponent's options, 
giving the hitter a great advantage.</p>
<p>
     Table tennis is governed by the worldwide organization International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), founded in 
1926. ITTF currently includes 226 member associations.[3] The table tennis official rules are specified in the 
ITTF handbook.[4] Table tennis has been an Olympic sport since 1988,[5] with several event categories. From 1988
 until 2004, these were men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles and women's doubles. Since 2008, a team event 
has been played instead of the doubles.

Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports,[1] with varied distance events in butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, and individual medley. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle.[2]

Swimming each stroke requires a set of specific techniques; in competition, there are distinct regulations concerning
 the acceptable form for each individual stroke.[3] There are also regulations on what types of swimsuits, caps, 
jewelry and injury tape that are allowed at competitions.[4] Although it is possible for competitive swimmers to 
incur several injuries from the sport, such as tendinitis in the shoulders or knees, there are also multiple health
 benefits associated with the sport.

Roller skating is traveling on surfaces with roller skates. It is a recreational activity, a sport, and a form of transportation. Roller rinks and skate parks are built for roller skating, though it also takes place on streets, sidewalks, and bike paths.

Roller skating originated in the performing arts in the 18th century. It gained widespread popularity starting in the 1880s. Roller skating was very popular in the United States from the 1930s to the 1950s, then again in the 1970s when it was associated with disco music and roller discos. During the 1990s, inline outdoor roller skating became popular.

Sport roller skating includes speed skating, roller hockey, roller derby, figure skating and aggressive quad skating.
